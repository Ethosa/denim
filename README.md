**Build native NodeJS addons powered by Nim.**

**Denim is a CLI toolkit for building native NodeJS addons** without touching a line of C/C++. Denim is a reimplementation of [andi23rosca/napi-nim](https://github.com/andi23rosca/napi-nim), fully written in Nim.

For using Denim you will need <code>node-gyp</code> module installed globally.
```bash
npm i -g node-gyp
# or using yarn
yarn global add node-gyp
```

Get the compiled version of Denim from latest release, or install the package from Nimble and compile it yourself
```bash
nimble install denim
# go to denim directory source and build the toolkit
nimble build
```

Once you have Denim installed on your system and set in your `PATH` you can simply call `denim -h` in your terminal and you get
