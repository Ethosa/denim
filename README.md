**Build native NodeJS addons powered by Nim.**

**Denim is a CLI toolkit for building native NodeJS addons**. Denim contains some work from Napi Nim by Andrei Rosca.

For using Denim you will need <code>node-gyp</code> module installed globally.
```bash
npm i -g node-gyp
# or using yarn
yarn global add node-gyp
```

Get the compiled version of Denim from latest release, or install the package from Nimble and compile it yourself
```bash
nimble install denim
```

Once you have Denim installed on your system and set in your `PATH` you can simply call `denim -h` in your terminal and you get
```bash
